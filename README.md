# Weather-Prediction
This Project involves building a neural network inorder to predict whether there will be rain tomorrow or not based on a number of factors like humidity, wind direction, pressure, windspeed, evaporation and a number of other factors.
In this deep learning model we have used early stopping library and added a dropout layers to avoid overfitting of the data by setting patience limit.
